## 📝 Final Note

This platform exists because **83% of Singaporean young adults** are uncertain about their direction, and **84%** don't feel a strong sense of belonging. These aren't just statistics — they represent real people who said:

> *"To cure my loneliness"*
> *"Someone to guide me through life"*
> *"Directionless, apathy and a general sense of nihilism towards the future"*

YUNO should be the answer to these struggles. Build something that helps Singaporean young adults finally answer:

### **"Who am I?"** and **"Where do I belong?"**
